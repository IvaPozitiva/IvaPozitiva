- 👋 Hi, I’m @IvaPozitiva, a passionate QA Engineer dedicated to delivering top-quality software through detailed testing and continuous improvement.
- 👀 I’m interested in test automation, continuous integration (CI), and improving testing processes to create efficient, bug-free software. I also love experimenting with mind maps for brainstorming and organizing complex projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning automation tools like Selenium and Cypress, and enhancing my skills in API testing with Postman and RestAssured. I'm also exploring test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that prioritize quality assurance, building automation pipelines, and implementing innovative test strategies.

- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not hunting for bugs in code, I love reading books, creating mind maps to visually organize my thoughts, hitting the trails for a hike, exploring the city on my bike, or sketching out new ideas!
